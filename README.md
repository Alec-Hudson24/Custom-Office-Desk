# Custom L-Shaped Gaming/Office Desk
**Hand-built, fully custom L-shaped desk designed for dual-monitor gaming, productivity, and cable management**  
*(Solo project: 3D modeling, woodworking, fabrication, and assembly)*

## Goal / Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - True L-shaped layout for maximum workspace (e.g., one side for PC/gaming rig, the other for secondary tasks or monitors).
  - Integrated cable management channels and hidden routing.
  - Sturdy, load-bearing construction capable of supporting heavy monitors, PC towers, peripherals, and desk accessories.
  - Custom dimensions tailored to room layout and ergonomic preferences (e.g., standing/sitting height options considered).
  - Aesthetic finish with clean edges, stain/paint, and optional RGB underglow mounting points.

- **Motivation**: Create a personalized, high-performance desk that off-the-shelf options couldn't match in size, shape, or features—while learning advanced woodworking and design skills.

- **Outcome**: Fully functional, rock-solid desk built from scratch. Overcame major challenges in joining the two long sections of the L perfectly (mitre joints, dowels, brackets, and reinforcement for seam strength and level alignment). Result: seamless appearance, no wobble, and professional-level stability. Long term durability still used 6 years later

## Programs and Skills Demonstrated
- **3D Modeling & Design**: SolidWorks (parametric modeling, assemblies, exploded views, rendering, dimensioned drawings, STL/STEP export for reference/fabrication)
- **Woodworking & Fabrication**: Material selection (cabinet grade plywood, Wooden countertop), cutting (table saw, miter saw, skill saw), joinery (biscuits/dowels/pocket screws for the critical L joint), sanding, finishing (stain and paint)
- **Problem-Solving**: Precise alignment and reinforcement of the L-joint to prevent sagging or twisting under load; custom jigs/templates for repeatable cuts; leveling during glue-up
- **Other**: Project planning, budgeting/material sourcing, iterative prototyping (test fits, mockups), solo end-to-end execution

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
- Detailed upfront 3D modeling saves massive time/material waste during physical build—catch interference or dimension issues early.
- The L-shape joint is the make-or-break part: over-engineer it (multiple reinforcement methods + glue + mechanical fasteners) for long-term durability.
- Test assembly dry-fit multiple times before final glue-up—irreversible steps demand patience.
- Custom builds let you optimize exactly for your needs (cable paths, monitor height, knee space), far better than mass-produced desks.

## Future Improvements / Ideas
- Add built-in power strip mounting and USB hubs
- Integrate under-desk drawer system or monitor arm mounts
- Experiment with live-edge hardwood accents or epoxy river elements
- Design modular add-ons (e.g., side shelves, keyboard tray)
